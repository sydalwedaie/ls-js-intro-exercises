## Ex07
Will an error occur if you try to access an array element with an index that is greater than or equal to the length of the array? For example:

```javascript
let foo = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
console.log(foo.length);  // => 3
console.log(foo[3]);      // will this result in an error?
```

## Solution
No. Trying to access a property that does not exist will get you `undefined`
