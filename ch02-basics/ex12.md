## Ex12

What value does the following expression evaluate to?

```javascript
'12' < '9'
```

## Solution
Trick question! Since we're comparing strings, the engine actually compares the ASCI value of each character, starting from the left. In this example, the engine first looks at `1` and compares it with `9` which is bigger. So the expression evaluates to true.
