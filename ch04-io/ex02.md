## Chapter 04 Exercise 02

Modify the greeter.js program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet the user with their full name.

```bash
$ node greeter.js
What is your first name? Sue
What is your last name? Roberts
Hello, Sue Roberts!
```

## Solution
```javascript
// greeter.js

let rlSync = require('readline-sync');
let firstName = rlSync.question('What is your first name? ');
let lastName = rlSync.question('What is your last name? ');
console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`); 
```
