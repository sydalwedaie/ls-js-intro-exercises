# Launch School Introduction to Programming End of Chapter Exercises

The book is a mandatory reading for the Launch School prep course.
Students were advised to do ALL the exercises and push them to a github repo.
Launch School may look at this repo to assess a candidate's rediness for the core curriculum.
