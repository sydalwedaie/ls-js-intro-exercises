## Chapter 05 Exercise 07

Without running the following code, what do you think it will output?

```javascript
function foo(bar, qux) {
  console.log(bar);
  console.log(qux);
}

foo('Hello');
```

## Solution

This program outputs the following:

```javascript
Hello
undefined
```

Reason being, `qux` get's initialized to `undefined`, but in the invocation is not assinged any value.
