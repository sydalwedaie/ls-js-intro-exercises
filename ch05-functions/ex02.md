## Chapter 05 Exercise 02

In the exercises for the previous chapter, you wrote a dynamic greeter program named 'greeter.js'. Add a function to this program that solicits the user's first and last names in separate invocations; the function should return the appropriate name as a string. Use the return values to greet the user with their full name.

## Solution

```javascript
// greeter.js - Enhanced version with a function

let rlSync = require('readline-sync');

function getName(message) {
  return rlSync.question(message);
}

let firstName = getName('What is your first name? ');
let lastName = getName('What is your last name? ');

console.log(`Hello, ${firstName} ${lastName}!`); 
```
