## Chapter 05 Exercise 04

What does the following code log to the console?

```javascript
function scream(words) {
  words = words + '!!!!';
  return;
  console.log(words);
}

scream('Yipeee');
```

## Solution

Nothing! The `return` statement terminates the function before the console.log command gets to output anythin.
