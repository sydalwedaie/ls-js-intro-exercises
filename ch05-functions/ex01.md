## Chapter 05 Exercise 01

What does this code log to the console? Does executing the 'foo' function affect the output? Why or why not?

```javascript
let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);
```

## Solution
The probram outputs '1'. Although 'bar' is a global variable, 'bar' is re-declared inside the 'foo' function. This new variable is completely independant from the global 'bar'.
