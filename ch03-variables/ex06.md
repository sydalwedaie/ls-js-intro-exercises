## Chapter 03 Exercise 06

Will this program produce an error when run? Why or why not?

```javascript
const FOO = 'bar';
{
  const FOO = 'qux';
}

console.log(FOO);
```

## Solution
No error. The second const decleration occurs inside a different scope, which has no idea of the other const declaration. Therefor, 'bar' is logged out with no problems.
