## Chapter 03 Exercise 05

What does this program log to the console? Why?

```javascript
let foo = 'bar';
{
  let foo = 'qux';
}

console.log(foo);
```

## Solution

The program logs 'bar' since the call to console.log has access to the `foo` variable in its visible scope.
The second declaration, `let foo = 'qaz'` is out of scope for the call to console.log.
