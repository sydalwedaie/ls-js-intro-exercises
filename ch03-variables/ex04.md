## Chapter 03 Exercise 04

What happens when you run the following code? Why?

```javascript
const NAME = 'Victor';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);

NAME = 'Joe';
console.log('Good Morning, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Afternoon, ' + NAME);
console.log('Good Evening, ' + NAME);
```

## Solution

The program fails at line where a reasignment is attempted on a constant.
The console logs after that won't run. To fix, we need to convert to a regular variable with `let`.
