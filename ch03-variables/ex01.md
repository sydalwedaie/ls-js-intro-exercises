## Chapter 03: Exercise 01

Write a program named greeter.js that greets 'Victor' three times. Your program should use a variable and not hard code the string value 'Victor' in each greeting. Here's an example run of the program:

```javascript
$ node greeter.js
Good Morning, Victor.
Good Afternoon, Victor.
Good Evening, Victor.
```

## Solution
```javascript
// greeter.js
let name = 'Victor';
console.log(`Good Morning, ${name}.`);
console.log(`Good Afternoon, ${name}.`);
console.log(`Good Evening, ${name}.`);
```
