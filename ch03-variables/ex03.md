## Chapter 03 Exercise 03

What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?

```javascript
{
  let foo = 'bar';
}

console.log(foo)
```

## Solution
We get an error: Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not definedu
Reason being, `foo` is block-scoped and hence, not visible to code outside that block.
